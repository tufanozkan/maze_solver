# Maze Solver AI

Welcome to the **Maze Solver AI** project! This cutting-edge application leverages advanced algorithms and Java Swing to tackle the classic problem of maze navigation. Designed with modern software engineering principles, this project showcases the power of object-oriented programming and real-time graphical interfaces to solve mazes in style.

## Project Highlights

In **Maze Solver AI**, we generate intricate mazes and deploy a sophisticated robot equipped with two distinct pathfinding methodologies:

1. **autoMove() Method**:
   - **Mechanism**: Utilizes a stack-based approach to track the robot's path through the maze. Each step is vividly visualized by coloring the path in green, creating a dynamic and engaging animation.
   - **User Experience**: Incorporates timed delays to allow users to observe the robot's journey in real-time, providing a clear and interactive view of the maze-solving process.

2. **algorithm() Method**:
   - **Mechanism**: Implements the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm, a cornerstone in pathfinding and graph traversal. This method offers a robust alternative for solving mazes and demonstrates the algorithm's efficacy in a practical scenario.
   - **Comparison**: Provides valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of DFS compared to the animation-based approach.

## Features

- **Advanced Maze Generation**: Automatically generates complex mazes for the robot to navigate, ensuring a unique challenge with every run.
- **Interactive Pathfinding Visualization**: Offers real-time animation of the robotâ€™s path, enhancing user engagement and understanding of maze-solving dynamics.
- **Algorithmic Precision**: Implements both a visual pathfinding method and a classic depth-first search algorithm, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of modern computational techniques.
  
## Technological Stack

- **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Harnesses the power of OOP principles to build a modular and scalable maze-solving application.
- **Java Constructor Design**: Employs advanced constructor techniques to initialize and manage maze components and robot behaviors.
- **Java Swing**: Utilizes Swing to create a rich graphical interface, delivering an interactive and visually appealing user experience.
