# maze_solver_AI

      In the project, a random maze is generated and a robot is created to solve this maze using two different methods. The first method autoMove() stores the path that the robot will follow to solve the maze in a stack. It then iterates over the stack and fills each cell in the path with a green color. The method also delays the animation for a certain amount of time, allowing the user to see how the robot navigates the maze. The second method algorithm() is similar to the first method, but it uses a different algorithm to solve the maze. The algorithm used by this method is a depth-first search algorithm.
